"""
This example cog demonstrates basic usage of Lavalink.py, using the DefaultPlayer.
As this example primarily showcases usage in conjunction with discord.py, you will need to make
modifications as necessary for use with another Discord library.

Usage of this cog requires Python 3.6 or higher due to the use of f-strings.
Compatibility with Python 3.5 should be possible if f-strings are removed.
